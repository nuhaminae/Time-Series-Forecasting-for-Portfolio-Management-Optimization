### Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

To forecast future asset returns, particularly TSLA, we compared two modelling approaches: a classical statistical model (ARIMA) and a deep learning model (LSTM). The objective was to identify a model that balances temporal pattern recognition, generalisability, and computational efficiency.

**Initial Model Comparison**:

| Model  | Asset | RMSE    | MAE     | R-squared |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| ARIMA  | TSLA  | 0.0040  | 0.0029  | -0.0068   |
|        | SPY   | 0.0103  | 0.0067  | 0.0046    |
|        | BND   | 0.0037  | 0.0029  | -0.0171   |
| LSTM   | TSLA  | 5.4204  | 4.6130  | 0.99      |
|        | SPY   | 38.736  | 34.0486 | 0.55      |
|        | BND   | 0.2     | 0.1632  | 0.99      |

- **ARIMA** yielded low error metrics but failed to explain variance, especially for TSLA and BND.
- **LSTM** achieved significantly higher R-squared scores, indicating stronger pattern recognition, particularly for assets with nonlinear behaviour.

Given its superior explanatory power and adaptability to volatility, **LSTM was selected** as the final model. It was then fine-tuned using early stopping, dropout regularisation, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance precision and stability across assets.

**Fine-Tuned LSTM Performance**
![TSLA Fine-Tuned](insights/finetuned_model/TSLA_asset_price_prediction_finetuned_lstm.png)
![SPY Fine-Tuned](insights/finetuned_model/SPY_asset_price_prediction_finetuned_lstm.png)
![BND Fine-Tuned](insights/finetuned_model/BND_asset_price_prediction_finetuned_lstm.png)

| Asset | RMSE    | MAE     | R-squared |
|-------|---------|---------|-----------|
| TSLA  | 0.1989  | 0.1616  | 0.5235    |
| SPY   | 0.0796  | 0.0538  | 0.1629    |
| BND   | 0.0161  | 0.0144  | 0.7203    |

- **TSLA**: Captures directional shifts with moderate accuracy; useful for trend anticipation, though less suited for short-term trading.
- **SPY**: Tracks stable movements with low error; ideal for conservative forecasting despite lower R-squared.
- **BND**: Near-perfect alignment with actuals; highly reliable for long-term projections and risk-adjusted allocation.

🧠 Summary of Model Utility

The fine-tuned LSTM model demonstrates strong adaptability across asset classes, balancing volatility sensitivity with forecast reliability.

| Asset | Volatility | Forecast Accuracy | Use Case                             |
|-------|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| TSLA  | High       | Moderate          | Trend anticipation, directional bets |
| SPY   | Medium     | High (short-term) | Stability anchor, low-risk exposure  |
| BND   | Low        | High              | Reliable baseline, risk dampener     |

![Historical Frontier](insights/portfolio/enhanced_frontier_Daily%20Return.png)
![Historical Allocation](insights/portfolio/allocation_comparison_Daily%20Return.png)

**Optimisation with Forecasted Returns**:

🔍 **Methodology Summary**

| Components             | Forecasted Scenario                      | Historical Scenario             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| TSLA Returns           | LSTM-based forward-looking sentiment     | LSTM-based historical momentum  |
| SPY & BND Returns      | Annualised historical mean daily returns | Same                            |
| Covariance Matrix Mean | 0.0100                                   | 0.0553                          |
| Covariance Matrix Max  | 0.0683                                   | 0.3503                          |
| Covariance Matrix Min  | -0.0018                                  | 0.0011                          |

🧮 **Portfolio Comparison**

| Portfolio Type                | TSLA Weight | BND Weight  | SPY Weight  | Expected Return | Expected Volatility | Sharpe Ratio  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Forecasted Max Sharpe         | 0.00%       | 81.10%      | 18.90%      | 4.33%           | 3.41%               | 1.27          |
| Forecasted Min Volatility     | 2.22%       | 89.16%      | 8.62%       | 2.72%           | 2.81%               | 0.97          |
| Historical Max Sharpe         | 10.09%      | 57.13%      | 32.78%      | 10.52%          | 11.08%              | 0.95          |
| Historical Min Volatility     | 2.22%       | 94.51%      | 5.49%       | 2.65%           | 5.40%               | 0.49          |

📈 **Visual Insights**

- **Efficient Frontier**: Both scenarios illustrate the risk-return trade-off, with optimal portfolios clearly marked.
- **Allocation Comparison**: Forecasted portfolios lean heavily on BND for stability, while historical portfolios tilt more aggressively toward TSLA and SPY.

🧠 **Interpretation & Recommendation**

- **Forecasted Optimisation**: TSLA is excluded from the Max Sharpe portfolio due to its projected volatility. BND dominates both portfolios, anchoring risk-adjusted efficiency.
- **Historical Optimisation**: TSLA earns a significant allocation in the Max Sharpe portfolio, reflecting confidence in its past performance. SPY’s weight increases, supporting a more growth-oriented stance.

>For GMF’s mandate prioritising downside protection, the **Forecasted Max Sharpe Portfolio** is recommended. It offers superior risk-adjusted returns with minimal exposure to volatile assets. The historical scenario, while more assertive, suits mandates that tolerate elevated risk for higher upside.

### Backtesting Results

To validate the viability of the optimised portfolio, a backtest was conducted over the final year of the dataset: August 2024 – July 2025. The strategy was benchmarked against a static 60/40 SPY/BND portfolio to assess relative performance.

![Asset Contributions](insights/backtesting/asset_contributions.png)

🧮 **Asset-Level Contributions**

- **TSLA** delivered the highest cumulative return, peaking near 2.0× before stabilising around 1.4×, confirming its high-growth, high-volatility profile.
- **SPY** showed steady growth, ending around 1.2×, reflecting broad market resilience.
- **BND** remained stable, fluctuating around 1.0×, reinforcing its role as a volatility buffer.

These results validate the asset-level assumptions used in portfolio construction: TSLA for upside, SPY for diversification, and BND for stability.

![Portfolio Performance](insights/backtesting/portfolio_performance.png)

🧮 **Portfolio Performances**

- The Optimised Portfolio (solid blue line) consistently outperformed the Benchmark Portfolio (dashed orange line) throughout the backtesting period.
- While both portfolios experienced fluctuations, the Optimised Portfolio maintained a higher trajectory, ending near 1.125× vs. the Benchmark’s ~1.05×.
- The divergence became more pronounced after March 2025, suggesting the optimiser’s allocations were well-aligned with evolving market conditions.

> The optimiser’s dynamic allocation, balancing TSLA’s upside with SPY’s diversification and BND’s stability, proved resilient and effective. The backtest confirms the model’s ability to adapt and outperform a static benchmark, reinforcing its suitability for real-world deployment.

📊 **Performance Summary**:

| Metrics               |Optimised Portfolio |Benchmark Portfolio   |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Annualised Volatility | 0.1316             | 0.1245               |
| Sharpe Ratio          | 1.0350             | 0.9601               |
| Total Return          | 13.43%             | 11.68%               |

- The Optimised Portfolio achieved a higher Sharpe Ratio, indicating superior risk-adjusted returns despite slightly higher volatility.
- A +1.75% uplift in total return over the benchmark validates the optimiser’s allocation logic.
- The volatility differential is modest, suggesting that the optimiser did not sacrifice stability for performance.

> The optimiser’s ability to deliver higher returns with only a marginal increase in volatility demonstrates its robustness. The Sharpe uplift confirms that the strategy is not just chasing returns, it’s managing risk intelligently.
